				Hi, my name is Ryan Cryar. I am currently a Student Developer at Oregon State University's Graduate school. I am
				an avid baker/chef, hiker, and love playing the guitar. I specialize in machine learning, and security, and have
				worked on many projects for the Univeristy. Links are included to my github, and other sites that you can reach me at. You can also
				find my projects that I have worked on, as well as my Resume.
				<strong>This is a work in progress! Please contact me at cryarr@oregonstate.edu if you have any questions,
					as of right now this is incomplete.</strong>
